        I&apos;m a passionate full-stack developer with 1+ years of experience
        building web applications using the MERN stack, Python, and other modern
        tools. I enjoy turning ideas into real products through clean, efficient
        code and have contributed to several open-source projects along the way.
        Currently, I&apos;m focused on full-stack development and diving into
        Web3â€”exploring smart contracts, blockchain integration, and how
        decentralized tech can reshape the web. When I&apos;m not coding,
        I&apos;m either learning something new in the Python or Web3 space, or
        mentoring newer developers to help them grow in tech.
